{{Ancient Rome and the fall of the Republic}}

'''Marcus Tullius Cicero'''{{efn|The name is infrequently [[anglicized]] as '''Tully'''<ref>E.g., in Howard Jones, ''Master Tully: Cicero in Tudor England'' (Nieuwkoop: De Graaf, 1998).</ref> ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ʌ|l|i}}).}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|ə|r|oʊ}} {{respell|SISS|ə|roh}}; {{IPA-la|ˈmaːrkʊs ˈtʊlːijʊs ˈkɪkɛroː|lang}}<!-- please note that i is [i] before vowels, not [ɪ] -->; 3 January 106&nbsp;– 7 December 43&nbsp;BC) was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman, lawyer, scholar, philosopher and [[Academic skepticism|Academic Skeptic]],<ref>Cicero, ''Academica'' Book II, Section 65</ref> who tried to uphold [[optimate]] principles during [[crisis of the Roman Republic|the political crises]] that led to the establishment of the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Ferguson|Balsdon}} [[Writings of Cicero|His extensive writings]] include treatises on [[rhetoric]], philosophy and politics, and he is considered one of Rome's greatest [[orator]]s and [[prose]] stylists.<ref>[[Elizabeth Rawson|Rawson, E.]]: ''Cicero, a portrait'' (1975) p. 303</ref><ref>Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'' (1964) pp. 300–01</ref> He came from a wealthy [[Municipium|municipal]] family of the [[Roman equestrian order]], and served as [[Roman consul|consul]] in 63&nbsp;BC.

His influence on the [[Latin]] language was immense. He wrote more than three-quarters of surviving Latin literature from the period of his adult life, and it has been said that subsequent prose was either a reaction against or a return to his style, not only in Latin but in European languages up to the 19th century.<ref name="Harrison2008">{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Harrison|title=A Companion to Latin Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RI0ivXkSqjAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-3737-9|page=31|quote=Latin literature in the period 90–40 BC presents one feature that is unique in Classical, and perhaps even in the whole of Western, literature. Although it is a period from which a substantial amount of literature in a wide variety of genres survives, more than 75 per cent of that literature was written by a single man: Marcus Tullius Cicero. Cicero wrote speeches, philosophical and rhetorical trea- tises, letters and poetry, which simply in terms of quantity outweigh all other extant writings of the period. }}</ref><ref name="Inc1995">{{Cite book |last=Merriam-Webster, Inc |title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-87779-042-6 |page=244 |chapter=Ciceronian period |access-date=27 August 2013 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&pg=PA244}}</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Selected Works'', 1971, p. 24</ref> Cicero introduced into Latin the arguments of the chief schools of [[Hellenistic philosophy]] and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary with [[neologisms]] such as ''evidentia'',<ref>''Q.

Though he was an accomplished orator and successful lawyer, Cicero believed his political career was his most important achievement. It was during his consulship that the [[second Catilinarian conspiracy]] attempted to overthrow the government through an attack on the city by outside forces, and Cicero suppressed the revolt by summarily and controversially executing five conspirators. During the chaotic middle period of the 1st century BC, marked by [[List of Roman civil wars and revolts|civil wars]] and the dictatorship of [[Julius Caesar]], Cicero championed a return to the traditional republican government. Following Caesar's death, Cicero became an enemy of [[Mark Antony]] in the ensuing power struggle, attacking him in a [[Philippicae|series of speeches]]. He was [[proscribed]] as an enemy of the state by the [[Second Triumvirate]] and consequently executed by soldiers operating on their behalf in 43&nbsp;BC after having been intercepted during an attempted flight from the Italian peninsula. His severed hands and head were then, as a final revenge of Mark Antony, displayed on the [[Rostra]].

[[Petrarch]]'s rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often credited for initiating the 14th-century [[Renaissance]] in [[Res publica|public affairs]], [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]], and classical Roman culture.<ref name="Wootton1996">{{Cite book |last=Wootton |first=David |url=https://archive.org/details/modernpoliticalt00woot |url-access=registration |title=Modern Political Thought: Readings from Machiavelli to Nietzsche |publisher=Hackett Publishing |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-87220-341-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/modernpoliticalt00woot/page/1 1] |access-date=27 August 2013}}</ref> According to Polish historian [[Tadeusz Stefan Zieliński|Tadeusz Zieliński]], "the Renaissance was above all things a revival of Cicero, and only after him and through him of the rest of Classical antiquity."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zieliński |first=Tadeusz |title=Cicero Im Wandel Der Jahrhunderte |publisher=Nabu Press}}</ref> The peak of Cicero's authority and prestige came during the 18th-century Enlightenment,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wood |first=Neal |title=Cicero's Social and Political Thought |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-520-07427-9}}</ref> and his impact on leading Enlightenment thinkers and political theorists such as [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Montesquieu]] and [[Edmund Burke]] was substantial.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nlnrac.org/classical/cicero |title=Cicero and the Natural Law |last=Nicgorski |first=Walter |publisher=Natural Law, Natural Rights, and American Constitutionalism}}</ref> His works rank among the most influential in European culture, and today still constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for the writing and revision of Roman history, especially the last days of the Roman Republic.<ref>{{cite book

==Personal life==
{{Main|Personal life of Cicero}}

===Early life===

Marcus Tullius Cicero was born on 3 January 106 BC<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/03/UPI-Almanac-for-Thursday-Jan-3-2019/1811546209344/ |title=UPI Almanac for Thursday, Jan. 3, 2019 |date=3 January 2019 |access-date=3 September 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103223323/https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/03/UPI-Almanac-for-Thursday-Jan-3-2019/1811546209344/ |archive-date=3 January 2019 |work=[[United Press International]] |quote=Roman philosopher Cicero in 106 B.C}}</ref> in [[Arpinum]], a hill town {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} southeast of Rome. He belonged to the ''[[Roman tribe|tribus]]'' Cornelia.<ref>''Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum'', [http://www.attalus.org/docs/sig2/s747.html 747].</ref> His father was a well-to-do member of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian order]] and possessed good connections in Rome.  However, being a semi-invalid, he could not enter public life and studied extensively to compensate. Although little is known about Cicero's mother, Helvia, it was common for the wives of important Roman citizens to be responsible for the management of the household. Cicero's brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus]] wrote in a letter that she was a thrifty housewife.<ref>Rawson, E.: ''Cicero, a portrait'' (1975) pp. 5–6; Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Fam.+16.26.2 16.26.2] (Quintus to Cicero)</ref>

Cicero's [[cognomen]], or personal surname, comes from the Latin for [[chickpea]], ''cicer''. [[Plutarch]] explains that the name was originally given to one of Cicero's ancestors who had a cleft in the tip of his nose resembling a chickpea. However, it is more likely that Cicero's ancestors prospered through the cultivation and sale of chickpeas.<ref>Trollope, Anthony. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8945/8945-h/8945-h.htm The Life of Cicero]'' Volume 1. p. 42</ref> Romans often chose down-to-earth personal surnames. The famous family names of [[Fabia gens|Fabius]], [[Lentulus]], and [[Calpurnia gens#Calpurnii Pisones|Piso]] come from the Latin names of beans, lentils, and peas, respectively. Plutarch writes that Cicero was urged to change this deprecatory name when he entered politics, but refused, saying that he would make ''Cicero'' more glorious than ''[[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Scaurus]]'' ("Swollen-ankled") and ''[[Gaius Lutatius Catulus|Catulus]]'' ("Puppy").<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#1.3 1.3–5]</ref>

[[File:The Young Cicero Reading.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Young Cicero Reading]]'' by [[Vincenzo Foppa]] (fresco, 1464), now at the [[Wallace Collection]]]]

During this period in Roman history, "cultured" meant being able to speak both Latin and Greek. Cicero was therefore educated in the teachings of the ancient Greek philosophers, poets and historians; as he obtained much of his understanding of the theory and practice of [[rhetoric]] from the Greek poet [[Aulus Licinius Archias|Archias]]<ref>[[Anthony Everitt|Everitt, A.]]:"Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician" (2001) p.34</ref> and from the Greek [[rhetoric]]ian [[Apollonius Molon|Apollonius]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/caesar*.html |title=Life of Caesar |last=Plutarch |website=[[University of Chicago]] |page=447 |quote=After this, Sulla's power being now on the wane, and Caesar's friends at home inviting him to return, Caesar sailed to Rhodes to study under Apollonius the son of Molon, an illustrious rhetorician with the reputation of a worthy character, of whom Cicero also was a pupil.}}</ref> Cicero used his knowledge of Greek to translate many of the theoretical concepts of Greek philosophy into Latin, thus translating Greek philosophical works for a larger audience. It was precisely his broad education that tied him to the traditional Roman elite.<ref name="everitt_p35">Everitt, A.: "Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician" (2001) p. 35</ref>

Cicero's interest in philosophy figured heavily in his later career and led to him providing a comprehensive account of Greek philosophy for a Roman audience,<ref>De Officiis, book 1, n. 1</ref> including creating a philosophical vocabulary in Latin.<ref>Everitt, A.:" Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician" (2001) pp. 253–55</ref> In 87 BC, [[Philo of Larissa]], the head of the [[Platonic Academy]] that had been founded by [[Plato]] in Athens about 300 years earlier, arrived in Rome. Cicero, "inspired by an extraordinary zeal for philosophy",<ref>Rawson: "Cicero, a portrait" (1975) p.18</ref> sat enthusiastically at his feet and absorbed [[Carneades]]' [[Academic skepticism|Academic Skeptic]] philosophy.<ref>J.P.F. Wynne, "Cicero's Skepticism" in ''Skepticism: From Antiquity to the Present'' Bloomsbury Academic 2018 p 93</ref>
Cicero said of Plato's Dialogues, that if Zeus were to speak, he would use their language.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/ancient-greece/plato-homepage.asp |title=Plato |website=www.ellopos.net}}</ref>

According to Plutarch, Cicero was an extremely talented student, whose learning attracted attention from all over Rome,<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#2.2 2.2]</ref> affording him the opportunity to study Roman law under [[Quintus Mucius Scaevola Augur|Quintus Mucius Scaevola]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#3.2 3.2]</ref> Cicero's fellow students were Gaius Marius Minor, [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]] (who became a famous lawyer, one of the few whom Cicero considered superior to himself in legal matters), and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Titus Pomponius]]. The latter two became Cicero's friends for life, and Pomponius (who later received the nickname "Atticus", and whose sister married Cicero's brother) would become, in Cicero's own words, "as a second brother", with both maintaining a lifelong correspondence.<ref name="everitt_p35" />

In 79 BC, Cicero left for [[Greece]], [[Asia Minor]] and [[Rhodes]]. This was perhaps to avoid the potential wrath of [[Sulla]], as Plutarch claims,<ref>Haskell, H.J.: "This was Cicero" (1940) p. 83</ref><ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#3.2 3.2–5]</ref> though Cicero himself says it was to hone his skills and improve his physical fitness.<ref>Cicero, ''Brutus'', 313–14</ref> In [[Athens]] he studied philosophy with [[Antiochus of Ascalon]], the 'Old Academic' and initiator of [[Middle Platonism]].<ref>Cicero, ''Brutus'', 315</ref> In Asia Minor, he met the leading orators of the region and continued to study with them. Cicero then journeyed to [[Rhodes]] to meet his former teacher, [[Apollonius Molon]], who had previously taught him in Rome. Molon helped Cicero hone the excesses in his style, as well as train his body and lungs for the demands of public speaking.<ref>Cicero, ''Brutus'', 316</ref> Charting a middle path between the competing [[Atticism|Attic]] and [[Asiatic style]]s, Cicero would ultimately become considered second only to [[Demosthenes]] among history's orators.<ref>Gesine Manuwald, Cicero: Philippics 3–9, vol. 2, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2007, pp. 129f</ref>
[[File:Porta Saturno, Quartiere Colle,Arpino .jpg|thumb|[[Arpino]], [[Italy]], birthplace of Cicero]]

===Family===
Cicero married [[Terentia]] probably at the age of 27, in 79 BC. According to the upper class [[wikt:mores#English|mores]] of the day it was a marriage of convenience, but lasted harmoniously for nearly 30 years. Terentia's family was wealthy, probably the [[Plebs|plebeian]] noble house of Terenti Varrones, thus meeting the needs of Cicero's political ambitions in both economic and social terms. She had a half-sister named Fabia, who as a child had become a [[Vestal Virgin]], a great honour. Terentia was a strong willed woman and (citing Plutarch) "she took more interest in her husband's political career than she allowed him to take in household affairs."<ref>Rawson, E.: "Cicero, a portrait" (1975) p. 25</ref>

In the 50s BC, Cicero's letters to Terentia became shorter and colder. He complained to his friends that Terentia had betrayed him but did not specify in which sense. Perhaps the marriage simply could not outlast the strain of the political upheaval in Rome, Cicero's involvement in it, and various other disputes between the two. The divorce appears to have taken place in 51 BC or shortly before.<ref>Susan Treggiari, ''Terentia, Tullia and Publilia: the women of Cicero's family'', London: Routledge, 2007, pp. 76ff.</ref> In 46 or 45 BC,<ref>Treggiari, op. cit., p. 133</ref> Cicero married a young girl, Publilia, who had been his [[ward (law)|ward]]. It is thought that Cicero needed her money, particularly after having to repay the [[dowry]] of Terentia, who came from a wealthy family.<ref name="Rawson_1975_225">Rawson, E.:   ''Cicero'' p. 225</ref> This marriage did not last long.

Although his marriage to Terentia was one of convenience, it is commonly known that Cicero held great love for his daughter [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia]].<ref>Haskell H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', p. 95</ref> When she suddenly became ill in February 45 BC and died after having seemingly recovered from giving birth to a son in January, Cicero was stunned. "I have lost the one thing that bound me to life" he wrote to Atticus.<ref name="Haskell_1964_249">Haskell, H.J.: "This was Cicero" (1964) p. 249</ref> Atticus told him to come for a visit during the first weeks of his bereavement, so that he could comfort him when his pain was at its greatest. In Atticus's large library, Cicero read everything that the Greek philosophers had written about overcoming grief, "but my sorrow defeats all consolation."<ref>Cicero, ''Letters to Atticus'', 12.14. Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'' p. 225</ref> Caesar and [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] as well as [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]] sent him letters of condolence.<ref>Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'' p. 226</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Samtliga brev/Collected letters''</ref>

Cicero hoped that his son [[Cicero Minor|Marcus]] would become a philosopher like him, but Marcus himself wished for a military career. He joined the army of [[Pompey]] in 49 BC and after Pompey's defeat at [[Battle of Pharsalus|Pharsalus]] 48 BC, he was pardoned by Caesar. Cicero sent him to Athens to study as a disciple of the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosopher [[Cratippus of Pergamon|Kratippos]] in 48 BC, but he used this absence from "his father's vigilant eye" to "eat, drink and be merry."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Haskell |first=H.J |title=This was Cicero |year=1964 |pages=103–04}}</ref> After Cicero's death he joined the army of the ''[[Liberatores]]'' but was later pardoned by [[Augustus]]. Augustus's bad conscience for not having objected to Cicero's being put on the [[proscription]] list during the [[Second Triumvirate]] led him to aid considerably Marcus Minor's career. He became an [[augur]], and was nominated [[Roman consul|consul]] in 30 BC together with Augustus. As such, he was responsible for revoking the honors of [[Mark Antony]], who was responsible for the proscription, and could in this way take revenge. Later he was appointed [[proconsul]] of [[Syria]] and the province of Asia.<ref>Paavo Castren & L. Pietilä-Castren: ''Antiikin käsikirja/Encyclopedia of the Ancient World''</ref>

==Public career==
{{Main|Political career of Cicero}}

===Early legal activity===
Cicero wanted to pursue a public career in politics along the steps of the [[Cursus honorum]]. In 90–88 BC, he served both [[Pompeius Strabo]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] as they campaigned in the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]], though he had no taste for military life, being an intellectual first and foremost.

Cicero started his career as a lawyer around 83–81 BC. The first extant speech is a private case from 81 BC (the ''[[pro Quinctio]]''), delivered when Cicero was aged 26, though he refers throughout to previous defenses he had already undertaken.<ref>E.g. Cicero, ''pro Quinctio'' 4</ref> His first major public case, of which a written record is still extant, was his 80 BC defense of [[Sextus Roscius]] on the charge of [[patricide]].<ref>Rawson, E.: "Cicero, a portrait" (1975) p. 22</ref> Taking this case was a courageous move for Cicero; patricide was considered an appalling crime, and the people whom Cicero accused of the murder, the most notorious being [[Lucius Cornelius Chrysogonus|Chrysogonus]], were favorites of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix|Sulla]]. At this time it would have been easy for Sulla to have the unknown Cicero murdered. Cicero's defense was an indirect challenge to the dictator Sulla, and on the strength of his case, Roscius was acquitted.<ref>Everitt, A.: "Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician" (2001) p. 61</ref> Soon after, Cicero again challenged Sulla, by criticising his disenfranchisement of Italian towns in a lost speech on behalf of a woman from [[Arezzo|Arretium]].<ref>Cicero, ''pro Caecina'' 97</ref>

Cicero's case in the ''[[Pro Roscio Amerino]]'' was divided into three parts. The first part detailed exactly the charge brought by Ericius. Cicero explained how a rustic son of a farmer, who lives off the pleasures of his own land, would not have gained anything from committing patricide because he would have eventually inherited his father's land anyway. The second part concerned the boldness and greed of two of the accusers, Magnus and Capito. Cicero told the jury that they were the more likely perpetrators of murder because the two were greedy, both for conspiring together against a fellow kinsman and, in particular, Magnus, for his boldness and for being unashamed to appear in court to support the false charges. The third part explained that Chrysogonus had immense political power, and the accusation was successfully made due to that power. Even though Chrysogonus may not have been what Cicero said he was, through rhetoric Cicero successfully made him appear to be a foreign freed man who prospered by devious means in the aftermath of the civil war. Cicero surmised that it showed what kind of a person he was and that something like murder was not beneath him.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Vasaly |first=Ann |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzEzMTI1X19BTg2?sid=c9ee3429-cd2e-4d40-9f34-5b332f61d12a@sessionmgr114&vid=1&format=EB&lpid=lp_156&rid=0 |title=Representation: Images of the World in a Ciceronian Territory |publisher=University of California Press |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-520-07755-3 |location=Berkeley |pages=158–68 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140306005520/http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzEzMTI1X19BTg2?sid=c9ee3429-cd2e-4d40-9f34-5b332f61d12a@sessionmgr114&vid=1&format=EB&lpid=lp_156&rid=0 |archive-date=6 March 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Early political career===
His first office was as one of the twenty annual [[quaestor]]s, a training post for serious public administration in a diversity of areas, but with a traditional emphasis on administration and rigorous accounting of public monies under the guidance of a senior magistrate or provincial commander. Cicero served as quaestor in western [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]] in 75 BC and demonstrated honesty and integrity in his dealings with the inhabitants. As a result, the grateful Sicilians asked Cicero to prosecute [[Gaius Verres]], a governor of Sicily, who had badly plundered the province. His prosecution of Gaius Verres was a great forensic success<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> for Cicero. Governor Gaius Verres hired the prominent lawyer of a noble family [[Quintus Hortensius|Quintus Hortensius Hortalus]]. After a lengthy period in Sicily collecting testimonials and evidence and persuading witnesses to come forward, Cicero returned to Rome and won the case in a series of dramatic court battles. His unique style of oratory set him apart from the flamboyant Hortensius. On the conclusion of this case, Cicero came to be considered the greatest orator in Rome. The view that Cicero may have taken the case for reasons of his own is viable. Hortensius was, at this point, known as the best lawyer in Rome; to beat him would guarantee much success and the prestige that Cicero needed to start his career. Cicero's oratorical skill is shown in his [[character assassination]] of Verres and various other techniques of persuasion used on the jury. One such example is found in the speech ''[[In Verrem|Against Verres I]]'', where he states "with you on this bench, gentlemen, with [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 67 BC)|Marcus Acilius Glabrio]] as your president, I do not understand what Verres can hope to achieve".<ref>Trans. Grant, Michael. Cicero: Selected Works. London: Penguin Books. 1960.</ref> Oratory was considered a great art in ancient Rome and an important tool for disseminating knowledge and promoting oneself in elections, in part because there were no regular newspapers or mass media. Cicero was neither a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] nor a plebeian [[nobiles|noble]]; his rise to political office despite his relatively humble origins has traditionally been attributed to his brilliance as an orator.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bartleby.com/268/2/11.html |title=III.

Cicero grew up in a time of civil unrest and war. [[Sulla]]'s victory in the first of a series of civil wars led to a new constitutional framework that undermined ''[[libertas]]'' (liberty), the fundamental value of the Roman Republic. Nonetheless, Sulla's reforms strengthened the position of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] class, contributing to that class's growing political power. Cicero was both an Italian ''eques'' and a ''[[novus homo]]'', but more importantly he was a [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|Roman constitutionalist]]. His social class and loyalty to the Republic ensured that he would "command the support and confidence of the people as well as the Italian middle classes". The ''[[optimates]]'' faction never truly accepted Cicero, and this undermined his efforts to reform the Republic while preserving the constitution. Nevertheless, he successfully ascended the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', holding each magistracy at or near the youngest possible age: [[quaestor]] in 75 BC (age 30), [[aedile]] in 69 BC (age 36), and [[praetor]] in 66 BC (age 39), when he served as president of the "Reclamation" (or extortion) Court. He was then elected [[Roman consul|consul]] at age 42.

He began his consular year by opposing a land bill proposed by a plebeian tribune which would have appointed commissioners with semi-permanent authority over land reform.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=43}}<ref name="JLP106" /> Cicero was also active in the courts, defending [[Gaius Rabirius (senator)|Gaius Rabirius]] from accusations of participating in the unlawful killing of plebeian tribune [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]] in 100 BC.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=44}} The prosecution occurred before the ''comita centuriata'' and threatened to reopen conflict between the Marian and Sullan factions at Rome.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=44}} Cicero defended the use of force as being authorised by a ''senatus consultum ultimum'', which would prove similar to his own use of force under such conditions.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=44}}

=== The Catilinarian Conspiracy ===
{{Main|Second Catilinarian conspiracy}}

[[File:Cicero - First speech against Catilina LATIN (Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina..).webm|thumb|right|Cicero - First speech against Catilina in Latin (English subtitles)]] Most famously{{snd}}in part because of his own publicity{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=42}}{{snd}}he thwarted a conspiracy led by [[Catiline|Lucius Sergius Catilina]] to overthrow the [[Roman Republic]] with the help of foreign armed forces. Cicero procured a ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' (a recommendation from the senate attempting to legitimise the use of force){{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=42}} and drove Catiline from the city with four vehement speeches (the [[Catiline Orations]]), which to this day remain outstanding examples of his rhetorical style. The Orations listed Catiline and his followers' debaucheries, and denounced Catiline's senatorial sympathizers as roguish and dissolute debtors clinging to Catiline as a final and desperate hope. Cicero demanded that Catiline and his followers leave the city. At the conclusion of Cicero's first speech (which was made in the [[Temple of Jupiter Stator (3rd century BC)|Temple of Jupiter Stator]]), Catiline hurriedly left the Senate. In his following speeches, Cicero did not directly address Catiline. He delivered <!--maybe; some scholars think not all the Catilinarians were actually delivered, but were rather published-->the second and third orations before the [[SPQR|people]], and the last one again before the Senate. By these speeches, Cicero wanted to prepare the Senate for the worst possible case; he also delivered more evidence, against Catiline.<ref>Cicero, Marcus Tullius, Selected Works, Penguin Books Ltd, Great Britain, 1971.</ref>

Catiline fled and left behind his followers to start the revolution from within while he himself assaulted the city with an army of "moral bankrupts and honest fanatics". It is alleged that Catiline had attempted to involve the [[Allobroges]], a tribe of [[Transalpine Gaul]], in their plot, but Cicero, working with the Gauls, was able to seize letters that incriminated the five conspirators and forced them to confess in front of the [[Roman Senate|senate]].<ref>Cicero, ''In Catilinam'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20080126211815/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Catil.+3.4 3.2]  (at the Perseus Project); Sallust, ''Bellum Catilinae'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#40 40–45] (at Lacus Curtius); Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#18.4 18.4] (at Lacus Curtius).</ref> The senate then deliberated upon the conspirators' punishment. As it was the dominant advisory body to the various [[legislative]] assemblies rather than a [[judicial]] body, there were limits to its power; however, martial law was in effect, and it was feared that simple house arrest or exile&nbsp;– the standard options&nbsp;– would not remove the threat to the state. At first [[Decimus Junius Silanus (consul)|Decimus Junius Silanus]] spoke for the "extreme penalty"; many were swayed by Julius Caesar, who decried the precedent it would set and argued in favor of life imprisonment in various Italian towns. [[Cato the Younger]] rose in defense of the death penalty and the entire Senate finally agreed on the matter. Cicero had the conspirators taken to the [[Tullianum]], the notorious Roman prison, where they were strangled. Cicero himself accompanied the former consul [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura]], one of the conspirators, to the Tullianum.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Cicero received the honorific "''[[Pater Patriae|pater patriae]]''" for his efforts to suppress the conspiracy, but lived thereafter in fear of trial or exile for having put Roman citizens to death without trial.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} While the ''senatus consultum ultimum'' gave some legitimacy to the use of force against the conspirators,{{Efn|Wiedemann describes the senatus consultum ultimum by the late republic as "little more than a fig-leaf by those who could muster a majority in the senate ... to legitimate the use of force".{{sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=44}}|name=|group=}} Cicero also argued that Catiline's conspiracy, by virtue of its treason, made the conspirators enemies of the state and forfeited the protections intrinsically possessed by Roman citizens.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=44}} The consuls moved decisively. Antonius Hybrida was dispatched to defeat Catiline in battle that year, preventing Crassus or Pompey from exploiting the situation for their own political aims.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=46}}

After the suppression of the conspiracy, Cicero was proud of his accomplishment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Some of his political enemies argued that though the act gained Cicero popularity, he exaggerated the extent of his success. He overestimated his popularity again several years later after being exiled from Italy and then allowed back from exile. At this time, he claimed that the [[Roman Republic|republic]] would be restored along with him.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Cicero (106–43 BC) |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/cicero/#H2 |access-date=21 October 2013 |last=Clayton |first=Edward}}</ref> Many Romans at the time, led by [[Populares]] politicians [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]] and patrician turned plebeian [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] believed that Cicero's evidence against Catiline was fabricated and the witnesses were bribed.

Shortly after completing his consulship, in late 62 BC, Cicero arranged the purchase of a large townhouse on the [[Palatine Hill]] previously owned by Rome's richest citizen, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]].{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=47}} It cost an exorbitant sum, 3.5&nbsp;million [[sesterces]], which required Cicero to arrange for a loan from his co-consul [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida]] based on the expected profits from Antonius's proconsulship in Macedonia.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Anthony Everitt |title=Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Orator |publisher=Random House |year=2003 |pages=115–16}}</ref><ref name="Dustan, William, 163-164">Dunstan, William (2010).

==Exile and return==
In 60 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] invited Cicero to be the fourth member of his existing partnership with [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus|Pompey]] and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], an assembly that would eventually be called the [[First Triumvirate]]. Cicero refused the invitation because he suspected it would undermine the Republic.<ref>Rawson, E.: ''Cicero'', 1984 106</ref>

During Caesar's consulship of 59 BC, the triumvirate had achieved many of their goals of land reform, publicani debt forgiveness, ratification of Pompeian conquests, etc. With Caesar leaving for his provinces, they wished to maintain their stranglehold on politics. They engineered the adoption of patrician [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] into a plebeian family and had him elected as one of the ten [[tribunes of the plebs]] for 58 BC.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=51}} Clodius used the triumvirate's backing to push through legislation that benefited them all. He introduced several laws (the ''[[leges Clodiae]]'') that made him very popular with the people, strengthening his power base, then he turned on Cicero by threatening exile to anyone who executed a Roman citizen without a trial. Cicero, having executed members of the Catiline conspiracy four years previously without formal trial, was clearly the intended target.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=50}} Furthermore, many believed that Clodius acted in concert with the triumvirate who feared that Cicero would seek to abolish many of Caesar's accomplishments while consul the year before. Cicero argued that the ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' indemnified him from punishment, and he attempted to gain the support of the senators and consuls, especially of Pompey.<ref>Tom Holland, ''Rubicon'', pp. 237–39.</ref>

Cicero grew out his hair, dressed in mourning and toured the streets. Clodius' gangs dogged him, hurling abuse, stones and even excrement. Hortensius, trying to rally to his old rival's support, was almost lynched. The Senate and the consuls were cowed. Caesar, who was still encamped near Rome, was apologetic but said he could do nothing when Cicero brought himself to grovel in the proconsul's tent. Everyone seemed to have abandoned Cicero.<ref>Tom Holland, ''Rubicon'', pp. 238–39.</ref>

After Clodius passed a law to deny to Cicero fire and water (i.e. shelter) within four hundred miles of Rome, Cicero went into exile.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=50}} He arrived at [[Thessalonica]], on 23 May 58&nbsp;BC.<ref>Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', (1964) p. 200</ref><ref>Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', (1964) p. 201</ref><ref>Plutarch. ''Cicero'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#32 32]</ref> In his absence, Clodius, who lived next door to Cicero on the Palatine, arranged for Cicero's house to be confiscated by the state, and was even able to purchase a part of the property in order to extend his own house.<ref name="cicero_house" /> After demolishing Cicero's house, Clodius had the land consecrated and symbolically erected a temple of [[Libertas|Liberty]] (''aedes Libertatis'') on the vacant spot.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Anthony Everitt |url=https://archive.org/details/cicerolifetimeso00ever |title=Cicero |publisher=Random House |year=2003 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cicerolifetimeso00ever/page/145 145] |isbn=9780375758959 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

Cicero's exile caused him to fall into depression. He wrote to [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]]: "Your pleas have prevented me from committing suicide. But what is there to live for? Don't blame me for complaining. My afflictions surpass any you ever heard of earlier".<ref>Haskell, H.J.: "This was Cicero" (1964) p. 201</ref> After the intervention of recently elected tribune [[Titus Annius Milo]], acting on the behalf of Pompey who wanted Cicero as a [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client]],{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=50}} the senate voted in favor of recalling Cicero from exile. Clodius cast the single vote against the decree. Cicero returned to Italy on 5 August 57&nbsp;BC, landing at [[Brundisium]].<ref>Cicero, ''Samtliga brev/Collected letters'' (in a Swedish translation)</ref> He was greeted by a cheering crowd, and, to his delight, his beloved daughter [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia]].<ref>Haskell. H.J.: ''This was Cicero'', p. 204</ref> In his ''Oratio De Domo Sua Ad Pontifices'', Cicero convinced the [[College of Pontiffs]] to rule that the consecration of his land was invalid, thereby allowing him to regain his property and rebuild his house on the Palatine.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Anthony Everitt |url=https://archive.org/details/cicerolifetimeso00ever |title=Cicero |publisher=Random House |year=2003 |page=[https://archive.org/details/cicerolifetimeso00ever/page/165 165] |isbn=9780375758959 |url-access=registration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Cicero |url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0020:text%3DDom.:chapter%3D1 |title=De Domo Sua |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>

Cicero tried to re-enter politics as an independent operator,{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=50}} but his attempts to attack portions of Caesar's legislation were unsuccessful{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=51}} and encouraged Caesar to re-solidify his political alliance with Pompey and Crassus.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=52}} The [[Lucca Conference|conference at Luca]] in 56&nbsp;BC left the three-man alliance in domination of the republic's politics; this forced Cicero to recant and support the triumvirate out of fear from being entirely excluded from public life.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=53}} After the conference Cicero lavishly praised Caesar's achievements, got the Senate to vote a thanksgiving for Caesar's victories and grant money to pay his troops.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} He also delivered a speech 'On the consular provinces' ({{Lang-la|de provinciis consularibus|lit=}}){{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=53}} which checked an attempt by Caesar's enemies to strip him of his provinces in Gaul.<ref>John Leach, ''Pompey the Great'', p. 144.</ref> After this, a cowed Cicero concentrated on his literary works. It is uncertain whether he was directly involved in politics for the following few years.<ref>Grant, M: "Cicero: Selected Works", p. 67</ref>

==Governorship of Cilicia==
In 51 BC he reluctantly accepted a [[Promagistrate|promagistracy]] (as proconsul) in [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Cilicia]] for the year; there were few other former consuls eligible as a result of a legislative requirement enacted by Pompey in 52&nbsp;BC specifying an interval of five years between a consulship or praetorship and a [[Roman province|provincial command]].{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=59}}<ref>Everitt, A. "Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician" (2001), pp. 186–88</ref> He served as [[proconsul]] of Cilicia from May 51, arriving in the provinces three months later around August.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=59}} He was given instructions to keep nearby [[Cappadocia]] loyal to King [[Ariobarzanes III of Cappadocia|Ariobarzanes III]], which he achieved 'satisfactorily without war'. In 53 BC Marcus Licinius Crassus had been defeated by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] at the [[Battle of Carrhae]]. This opened up the Roman East for a Parthian invasion, causing much unrest in Syria and Cilicia. Cicero restored calm by his mild system of government. He discovered that a great amount of public property had been embezzled by corrupt previous governors and members of their staff, and did his utmost to restore it. Thus he greatly improved the condition of the cities.<ref>[[Alfred John Church]], ''Roman Life in the Days of Cicero'', (Kindle edition), ch. XIII., loc. 1834</ref> He retained the civil rights of, and exempted from penalties, the men who gave the property back.<ref>Church, loc. 1871</ref> Besides this, he was extremely frugal in his outlays for staff and private expenses during his governorship, and this made him highly popular among the natives.<ref>Church, loc. 1834</ref> Previous governors had extorted enormous sums from the provincials in order to supply their households and bodyguards.

Besides his activity in ameliorating the hard pecuniary situation of the province, Cicero was also creditably active in the military sphere. Early in his governorship he received information that prince [[Pacorus I|Pacorus]], son of [[Orodes II]] the king of the Parthians, had crossed the [[Euphrates]], and was ravaging the Syrian countryside and had even besieged [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] (the interim Roman commander in Syria) in [[Antioch]].<ref>Church, loc. 1845; Gareth C. Sampson, ''The defeat of Rome, Crassus, Carrhae & the invasion of the East'', pp. 155–58; Cicero, ''Letters to friends'', 15.3.1.</ref> Cicero eventually marched with two understrength legions and a large contingent of auxiliary cavalry to Cassius's relief. Pacorus and his army had already given up on besieging Antioch and were heading south through Syria, ravaging the countryside again, Cassius and his legions followed them, harrying them wherever they went, eventually ambushing and defeating them near Antigonea.<ref>Gareth C. Sampson, ''The defeat of Rome, Crassus, Carrhae & the invasion of the East'', p.159; Cicero, ''Letters to friends'', 2.10.2.</ref> Another large troop of Parthian horsemen was defeated by Cicero's cavalry who happened to run into them while scouting ahead of the main army. Cicero next defeated some robbers who were based on [[Nur Mountains|Mount Amanus]] and was hailed as [[imperator]] by his troops. Afterwards he led his army against the independent Cilician mountain tribes, besieging their fortress of [[Pindenissum]]. It took him 47 days to reduce the place, which fell in December.<ref>Church, loc. 1855</ref> Then Cicero left the province on 30 July{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=62}} to his brother [[Quintus Cicero|Quintus]], who had accompanied him on his governorship as his [[Legatus|legate]].<ref>Church, ibid</ref> On his way back to Rome he stopped over in [[Rhodes]] and then went to [[Athens]], where he caught up with his old friend [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]] and met men of great learning.<ref>Plutarch, The Life of Cicero, 36.</ref>

==Julius Caesar's civil war==
Cicero arrived in Rome on 4 January 49 BC.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=62}} He stayed outside the [[pomerium]], to retain his promagisterial powers: either in expectation of a triumph or to retain his independent command authority in the coming civil war.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=62}} The struggle between [[Pompey]] and Julius Caesar grew more intense in 50 BC. Cicero favored Pompey, seeing him as a defender of the senate and Republican tradition, but at that time avoided openly alienating Caesar.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/caesar*.html |title=Life of Caesar |last=Plutarch |website=University of Chicago |page=575 |quote=It was Cicero who proposed the first honours for [Caesar] in the senate, and their magnitude was, after all, not too great for a man; but others added excessive honours and vied with one another in proposing them, thus rendering Caesar odious and obnoxious even to the mildest citizens because of the pretension and extravagance of what was decreed for him.}}</ref> When Caesar invaded Italy in 49 BC, Cicero fled Rome. Caesar, seeking an endorsement by a senior senator, courted Cicero's favor, but even so Cicero slipped out of Italy and traveled to Dyrrachium ([[Epidamnos]]), Illyria, where Pompey's staff was situated.<ref>Everitt, Anthony: ''Cicero'' p. 215.</ref> Cicero traveled with the Pompeian forces to [[Pharsalus]] in 48 BC,<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#38 38.1]</ref> though he was quickly losing faith in the competence and righteousness of the Pompeian side. Eventually, he provoked the hostility of his fellow senator [[Cato the Younger|Cato]], who told him that he would have been of more use to the cause of the ''optimates'' if he had stayed in Rome. After Caesar's victory at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] on 9 August, Cicero refused to take command of the Pompeian forces and continue the war.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=63}} He returned to Rome, still as a promagistrate with his lictors, in 47 BC, and dismissed them upon his crossing the pomerium and renouncing his command.{{Sfn|Wiedemann|1994|p=63}} Caesar pardoned him and Cicero tried to adjust to the situation and maintain his political work, hoping that Caesar might revive the Republic and its institutions.

In a letter to [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] on c. 20 April 46 BC, Cicero outlined his strategy under Caesar's dictatorship. Cicero, however, was taken completely by surprise when the ''[[Liberatores]]'' assassinated Caesar on the [[ides of March]], 44 BC. Cicero was not included in the conspiracy, even though the conspirators were sure of his sympathy. [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]] called out Cicero's name, asking him to restore the republic when he lifted his bloodstained dagger after the assassination.<ref>Cicero, ''Second Philippic'' Against Antony</ref> A letter Cicero wrote in February 43 BC to [[Trebonius]], one of the conspirators, began, "How I could wish that you had invited me to that most glorious banquet on the [[Ides of March]]!"<ref>Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/fam10.shtml#28 10.28].</ref><ref>Matthew B Schwartz, Finley Hooper, ''Roman Letters: History from a Personal Point of View'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WbhoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA48 p. 48].</ref> Cicero became a popular leader during the period of instability following the assassination. He had no respect for [[Mark Antony]], who was scheming to take revenge upon Caesar's murderers. In exchange for amnesty for the assassins, he arranged for the Senate to agree not to declare Caesar to have been a [[tyrant]], which allowed the Caesarians to have lawful support and kept Caesar's reforms and policies intact.<ref>Cecil W. Wooten, "Cicero's Philippics and Their Demosthenic Model" [[University of North Carolina Press]]</ref>

==Opposition to Mark Antony and death==
[[File:Assassinat de Cicéron.jpg|thumb|Cicero's death (France, 15th century)]]

Cicero and Antony now became the two leading men in Rome: Cicero as spokesman for the Senate; Antony as consul, leader of the Caesarian faction, and unofficial executor of Caesar's public will. Relations between the two, never friendly, worsened after Cicero claimed that Antony was taking liberties in interpreting Caesar's wishes and intentions. [[Augustus|Octavian]] was Caesar's adopted son and heir. After he returned to Italy, Cicero began to play him against Antony. He praised Octavian, declaring he would not make the same mistakes as his father. He attacked Antony in a series of speeches he called the [[Philippicae|Philippics]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/whic/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?zid=5f8cc5dc35ef36395a3da25a000441ad&action=2&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CCX2878000037&userGroupName=ein_remote&jsid=c02d33644f4e1beaed19877135f2bf8c |title=World History in Context |website=ic.galegroup.com |language=en |access-date=3 January 2018}}</ref> after [[Demosthenes]]'s denunciations of [[Philip&nbsp;II of Macedon]]. At the time Cicero's popularity as a public figure was unrivalled.<ref>Appian, ''Civil Wars'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/4*.html#19 4.19]</ref>

[[File:Fulvia y Marco Antonio, o La venganza de Fulvia (Museo del Prado).jpg|thumb|left|upright=2|''The Vengeance of Fulvia'' by Francisco Maura y Montaner, 1888 depicting Fulvia inspecting the severed head of Cicero]]

Cicero supported [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]] as governor of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (''Gallia Cisalpina'') and urged the Senate to name Antony an enemy of the state. The speech of [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Piso]], Caesar's father-in-law, delayed proceedings against Antony. Antony was later declared an [[enemy of the state]] when he refused to lift the siege of [[Mutina]], which was in the hands of Decimus Brutus. Cicero's plan to drive out Antony failed. Antony and Octavian reconciled and allied with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]] to form the [[Second Triumvirate]] after the successive battles of [[Battle of Forum Gallorum|Forum Gallorum]] and [[Battle of Mutina|Mutina]]. The Triumvirate began [[proscription|proscribing]] their enemies and potential rivals immediately after legislating the alliance into official existence for a term of five years with consular ''[[imperium]]''. Cicero and all of his contacts and supporters were numbered among the enemies of the state, even though Octavian argued for two days against Cicero being added to the list.<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#46.3 46.3–5]</ref>

Cicero was one of the most viciously and doggedly hunted among the proscribed. He was viewed with sympathy by a large segment of the public and many people refused to report that they had seen him. He was caught on 7 December 43&nbsp;BC leaving his villa in [[Formiae]] in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] heading to the seaside, where he hoped to embark on a ship destined for Macedonia.<ref name="Haskell_1964_293">Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'' (1964) p. 293</ref> When his killers – Herennius (a Centurion) and Popilius (a Tribune) – arrived, Cicero's own slaves said they had not seen him, but he was given away by Philologus, a [[freedman]] of his brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero|Quintus Cicero]].<ref name="Haskell_1964_293" />

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|Cicero about age&nbsp;60, from a marble bust]]

As reported by [[Seneca the Elder]], according to the historian [[Aufidius Bassus]], Cicero's last words are said to have been "I go no further: approach, veteran soldier, and, if you can at least do so much properly, sever this neck. [...] What would you have done had you come to me as your first victim?"<ref>Seneca, ''Suasoria'' 6:18 (http://www.attalus.org/translate/suasoria6.html)</ref> He bowed to his captors, leaning his head out of the litter in a gladiatorial gesture to ease the task. By baring his neck and throat to the soldiers, he was indicating that he would not resist. According to [[Plutarch]], Herennius first slew him, then cut off his head. On Antony's instructions his hands, which had penned the Philippics against Antony, were cut off as well; these were nailed along with his head on the [[Rostra]] in the [[Roman Forum|Forum Romanum]] according to the tradition of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] and [[Sulla]], both of whom had displayed the heads of their enemies in the Forum. Cicero was the only victim of the proscriptions who was displayed in that manner. According to Cassius Dio (in a story often mistakenly attributed to Plutarch),<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/47*.html#8.4 47.8.4]</ref> Antony's wife [[Fulvia]] took Cicero's head, pulled out his tongue, and jabbed it repeatedly with her hairpin in final revenge against Cicero's power of speech.<ref>Everitt, A.: ''Cicero, A turbulent life'' (2001)</ref>

Cicero's son, [[Cicero Minor|Marcus Tullius Cicero Minor]], during his year as a consul in 30&nbsp;BC, avenged his father's death, to a certain extent, when he announced to the Senate Mark Antony's naval defeat at [[Battle of Actium|Actium]] in 31&nbsp;BC by Octavian and his commander-in-chief, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]].{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

Octavian is reported to have praised Cicero as a patriot and a scholar of meaning in later times, within the circle of his family.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Cicero'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#49.5 49.5]</ref> However, it was Octavian's acquiescence that had allowed Cicero to be killed, as Cicero was condemned by the new triumvirate.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Baños|first=José|date=2019-02-26|title=The brutal beheading of Cicero, last defender of the Roman Republic|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/2019/02/brutal-beheading-cicero-last-defender-roman-republic|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-15|website=National Geographic|language=en-gb}}</ref>

Cicero's career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate. His indecision may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change.
"Would that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater self-control, and adversity with more fortitude!" wrote [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|C. Asinius Pollio]], a contemporary Roman statesman and historian.<ref>Haskell, H.J.

Cicero has been traditionally considered the master of Latin prose, with [[Quintilian]] declaring that Cicero was "not the name of a man, but of eloquence itself."<ref>Quintilian, [[Institutio Oratoria]] 10.1.1 12</ref> The English words ''[[wikt:Ciceronian|Ciceronian]]'' (meaning "eloquent") and ''[[wikt:cicerone|cicerone]]'' (meaning "local guide") derive from his name.<ref>{{OEtymD|Ciceronian}}</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|cicerone}}</ref> He is credited with transforming Latin from a modest utilitarian language into a versatile literary medium capable of expressing abstract and complicated thoughts with clarity.<ref>''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature'', "Ciceronian period" (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&pg=PA244 p. 244]</ref> [[Julius Caesar]] praised Cicero's achievement by saying "it is more important to have greatly extended the frontiers of the Roman spirit than the frontiers of the Roman empire".<ref>Pliny, ''Natural History'', 7.117</ref> According to [[John William Mackail]], "Cicero's unique and imperishable glory is that he created the language of the civilized world, and used that language to create a style which nineteen centuries have not replaced, and in some respects have hardly altered."<ref>Cicero, ''Seven orations'', 1912</ref>

Cicero was also an energetic writer with an interest in a wide variety of subjects, in keeping with the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophical]] and rhetorical traditions in which he was trained. The quality and ready accessibility of Ciceronian texts favored very wide distribution and inclusion in teaching curricula, as suggested by a graffito at Pompeii, admonishing: "You will like Cicero, or you will be whipped".<ref>Hasan Niyazi, ''From Pompeii to Cyberspace – Transcending barriers with Twitter'' {{Cite web |url=http://www.3pipe.net/2011/05/from-pompeii-to-cyberspace-transcending.html |title=Account Suspended |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114062841/http://www.3pipe.net/2011/05/from-pompeii-to-cyberspace-transcending.html |archive-date=14 November 2012 |access-date=7 September 2012}}</ref>
Cicero was greatly admired by influential [[Church Fathers]] such as [[Augustine of Hippo]], who credited Cicero's [[lost work |lost]] ''[[Hortensius (Cicero)|Hortensius]]'' for his eventual conversion to Christianity,<ref>Augustine of Hippo, ''Confessions'', 3:4</ref> and St. [[Jerome]], who had a feverish vision in which he was accused of being "follower of Cicero and not of Christ" before the judgment seat.<ref>Jerome, ''Letter to Eustochium'', XXII:30</ref>
This influence further increased after the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Early Middle Ages]] in Europe, which more of his writings survived than any other Latin author. Medieval philosophers were influenced by Cicero's writings on [[natural law]] and innate rights.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Goodey |first=C.F. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgaiAgAAQBAJ&q=Medieval+philosophers+were+influenced+by+Cicero's+writings+on+natural+law+and+innate+rights.&pg=PA154 |title=A History of Intelligence and 'Intellectual Disability': The Shaping of Psychology in Early Modern Europe |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4094-8235-2 |language=en}}{{page needed|date=December 2020}}</ref>{{additional citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[Petrarch]]'s rediscovery of Cicero's letters provided the impetus for searches for ancient Greek and Latin writings scattered throughout European monasteries, and the subsequent rediscovery of [[classical antiquity]] led to the [[Renaissance]]. Subsequently, Cicero became synonymous with classical Latin to such an extent that a number of humanist scholars began to assert that no Latin word or phrase should be used unless it appeared in Cicero's works, a stance criticised by [[Erasmus]].<ref>Erasmus, [[Ciceronianus]]</ref>

His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]], has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture. [[Cornelius Nepos]], the 1st century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero's letters contained such a wealth of detail "concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government" that their reader had little need for a history of the period.<ref>Cornelius Nepos, ''[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nepos.htm#Atticus Atticus]'' 16, trans. John Selby Watson.</ref>

Among Cicero's admirers were [[Desiderius Erasmus]], [[Martin Luther]], and [[John Locke]].<ref>Richards 2010, p.121</ref> Following the invention of Johannes Gutenberg's printing press, ''[[De Officiis]]'' was the second book printed in Europe, after the [[Gutenberg Bible]]. Scholars note Cicero's influence on the rebirth of religious toleration in the 17th century.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=12681 |title=John Marshall.

Cicero was especially popular with the [[Philosophes]] of the 18th century, including [[Edward Gibbon]], [[Diderot]], [[David Hume]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[Voltaire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Peter Gay |title=The Enlightenment: An Interpretation |publisher=W.W.

Internationally, Cicero the republican inspired the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and the revolutionaries of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>De Burgh, W.G., "The legacy of the ancient world"</ref> [[John Adams]] said, "As all the ages of the world have not produced a greater statesman and philosopher united than Cicero, his authority should have great weight."<ref>''American republicanism: Roman Ideology in the United States'' [[Mortimer Sellers|Mortimer N. S. Sellers]], NYU Press, 1994</ref> Jefferson names Cicero as one of a handful of major figures who contributed to a tradition "of public right" that informed his draft of the Declaration of Independence and shaped American understandings of "the common sense" basis for the right of revolution.<ref>Thomas Jefferson, "Letter to Henry Lee," 8 May 1825, in The Political Thought of American Statesmen, eds. Morton Frisch and Richard Stevens (Itasca, Ill.: F. E. Peacock Publishers, 1973), 12.</ref> [[Camille Desmoulins]] said of the French republicans in 1789 that they were "mostly young people who, nourished by the reading of Cicero at school, had become passionate enthusiasts for liberty".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Aulard |first=François-Alphonse |url=https://archive.org/details/histoirepolitiqu01aula |title=Histoire politique de la Révolution française: Origines et Développement de la Démocratie et de la République (1789–1804) |publisher=Librairie Armand Colin |year=1901 |page=[https://archive.org/details/histoirepolitiqu01aula/page/5 5]}}</ref>

[[Jim Powell (historian)|Jim Powell]] starts his book on the history of liberty with the sentence: "Marcus Tullius Cicero expressed principles that became the bedrock of liberty in the modern world."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Powell |first=Jim |url=https://archive.org/details/triumphofliberty00powe/page/2 |title=The Triumph of Liberty: A 2,000 Year History Told Through the Lives of Freedom's Greatest Champions |date=2000 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=978-0-684-85967-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/triumphofliberty00powe/page/2 2–10]}}</ref>

Likewise, no other ancient personality has inspired as much venomous dislike as Cicero, especially in more modern times.<ref>Bailey, D.R.S. "Cicero's letters to Atticus" (1978) p. 16</ref> His commitment to the values of the Republic accommodated a hatred of the poor and persistent opposition to the advocates and mechanisms of popular representation.<ref>''Letters to Atticus I & II''</ref> [[Friedrich Engels]] referred to him as "the most contemptible scoundrel in history" for upholding republican "democracy" while at the same time denouncing land and class reforms.<ref>Noted in Michael Parenti, ''The Assassination of Julius Caesar: A People's History of Ancient Rome'', 2003:86. {{ISBN|1-56584-797-0}}</ref> Cicero has faced criticism for exaggerating the democratic qualities of republican Rome, and for defending the Roman oligarchy against the popular reforms of Caesar.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://elearning-gilman.remote-learner.net/pluginfile.php/51701/mod_resource/content/0/Cicero--Justifying_Caesar_s_Death.pdf |title=On Duties |last=Cicero |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119051143/https://elearning-gilman.remote-learner.net/pluginfile.php/51701/mod_resource/content/0/Cicero--Justifying_Caesar_s_Death.pdf |archive-date=19 January 2017 }}</ref> [[Michael Parenti]] admits Cicero's abilities as an orator, but finds him a vain, pompous and hypocritical personality who, when it suited him, could show public support for popular causes that he privately despised.

Cicero also had an influence on modern astronomy.

Cicero was declared a [[righteous pagan]] by the [[Chalcedonian Christianity|Early Church]],<ref>Everitt, A., ''Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician'' (2003), p. 259</ref> and therefore many of his works were deemed worthy of preservation. The [[Bogomils]] considered him a rare exception of a pagan saint.<ref>De Burgh, W.G.</ref> Subsequent Roman and medieval Christian writers quoted liberally from his works ''[[De Re Publica]]'' (''On the Commonwealth'') and ''[[De Legibus]]'' (''On the Laws''), and much of his work has been recreated from these surviving fragments. Cicero also articulated an early, abstract conceptualization of rights, based on ancient law and custom.

==In archaeology==
Cicero's great repute in Italy has led to numerous ruins being identified as having belonged to him, though none have been substantiated with absolute certainty. In [[Formia]], two Roman-era ruins are popularly believed to be Cicero's mausoleum, the ''Tomba di Cicerone'', and the villa where he was assassinated in 43 BC. The latter building is centered around a central hall with Doric columns and a coffered vault, with a separate [[nymphaeum]], on five acres of land near Formia.<ref>{{Cite news |last=L.

Cicero's supposed tomb is a 24-meter (79 feet) tall tower on an ''[[opus quadratum]]'' base on the ancient Via Appia outside of Formia. Some suggest that it is not in fact Cicero's tomb, but a monument built on the spot where Cicero was intercepted and assassinated while trying to reach the sea.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Redazione ANSA |url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2015/07/21/mayor-launches-appeal-to-save-ciceros-villa-from-ruin_55a57cf3-5104-4a1a-8e19-bc4cd3261dbd.html |title=Mayor launches appeal to save Cicero's villa from ruin |date=25 July 2015 |access-date=19 June 2018 |publisher=ANSA English}}</ref>

In [[Pompeii]], a large villa excavated in the mid 18th century just outside the Herculaneum Gate was widely believed to have been Cicero's, who was known to have owned a holiday villa in Pompeii he called his ''Pompeianum''. The villa was stripped of its fine frescoes and mosaics and then re-buried after 1763 – it has yet to be re-excavated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pompeiiinpictures.com/pompeiiinpictures/RV/Villa%20Cicero.htm |title=Villa Cicero |publisher=pompeiiinpictures.com |access-date=19 June 2018}}</ref> However, contemporaneous descriptions of the building from the excavators combined with Cicero's own references to his ''Pompeianum'' differ, making it unlikely that it is Cicero's villa.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mary Beard |title=The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=2010 |page=45}}</ref>
